My individual contribution to this project was being the team leader/manager, and
 lead developer. I was responsible for developing the code base for the software. This
 includes filtering data input and developing the algorithm to feed the data into. Which
 controls the solar panel position by applying input to the stepper motor.
 The skills I built upon were learning how to interface with hardware through
 arduino code. Designing circuits, which I had little experience in. As well as getting a
 better understanding of how solar panels operate. This includes an understanding of
 how their electrical data output correlates with their position to a light source. I ran into
 many issues during the project. They were all hardware related. Some examples
 include the initial current sensor used was not sensitive enough. The servo motors were
 also not accurate with positioning, which needed to be tracked for the algorithm to
 operate correctly. So these parts had to be swapped and the circuit completely
 redesigned.
