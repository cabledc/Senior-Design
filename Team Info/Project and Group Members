Project Abstract
Our senior design project focuses on enhancing solar energy efficiency through a sun tracking system controlled by Arduino. By continuously adjusting solar panel orientation to follow the sun's path, our project aims to optimize energy output. 
We will develop an Arduino based control system that calculates the sun's position, while a mechanical system with sensors ensures accurate alignment. We will also implement energy monitoring and data logging to assess system performance. 
This project seeks to make solar power more efficient, contributing to sustainable energy solutions.
