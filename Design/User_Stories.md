- As the lead engineer for a green energy company, I want our solar panels to track the sun's position, so we can maximize the energy output and efficiency per panel.

- As a solar energy customer, I have limited area for a solar panel installation, so the panels should get as much sunlight as possible throughout the day.

- As a material scientist, I need ways of increasing output of our current solar cells, without using more expensive materials.
