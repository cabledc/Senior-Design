# Hardware Setup

## Components needed
- DC 5V to DC 9V USB Voltage Step Up Converter Cable 
- 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor and motor control board
- ELGATO UNO R3 Compatible with Arduino IDE or an Arduino R3 equivalent board
- Sunnytech 0.5w 5v 100ma Mini Small Solar Panel Module DIY Polysilicon Solar Epoxy Cell Charger B016 or an equivalent 0.5w 5v 100ma solar panel
- 5A Current Sensor Module ACS712 Module Compatible for Arduino
- 3.7V Lithium ion Battery 1100mAh 603449 Rechargeable 3.7 Volt Lipo Battery Pack or an equivalent battery pack
- 900mA MPPT Solar Panel Controller
- Wiring for connecting components
- Male to male Usb connector for the Arduino board (for installing software and connecting the charge controller) This should come with the Arduino board
- A computer or laptop than can run Arduino IDE
- Access to a 3D printer to mount the solar panel to the stepper motor. (You can improvise and make your own if you don't have access to a 3D printer)

## Circuit Setup
- The circuit below represents a **setup with the software installed**. When installing the software plug the arduino into the pc through the usb port. When finished, disconnect from the PC/Laptop and attach the charge controller back to the arduino.
