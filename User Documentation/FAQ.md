## FAQ
> **Do I need to calibrate the device?**
> 
> > *No the device should calibrate on its own when place outside, ideally in a non obscured location.*
>   
> **What if the battery is dead when setting up the device?**
> 
> > *If the battery is completely dead the solar panel will still get sunlight, and eventually provide power to the battery and the device itself. It will eventually go through calibration and orient itself correctly.*
>   
> **Is the device waterproof?**
> 
> > *A housing is required for waterproofing the electronics. Exposing the board or wire connectors to the elements will likely damage it. You can either make one by hand or download the 3D print files [here](https://github.com/cabledc/Senior-Design-Solar-Maximum/tree/main/3D%20Printer%20Files). Guide for attaching 3D printed the housing is [here](https://github.com/cabledc/Senior-Design-Solar-Maximum/blob/main/User%20Documentation/3D%20Printed%20Housing%20Setup.md)*

> **Does my operating system matter for setup?**
> 
> > *Arduino IDE runs on Windows, Apple, and Linux systems. Select the corresponding download for your operating system*
>
> **How can I edit the sketch file while the device is running?**
> > *One of the hardware components required is a DC 5V to DC 9V USB Voltage Step Up Converter Cable. This cable plugs into the arduino board to power in the 9v port, and the usb into the solar controller. This frees up the usb port on the arduino allowing you to plug the entire device into your PC/Laptop.**
