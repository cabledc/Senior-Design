## FAQ
> **Do I need to calibrate the device?**
> 
> > No the device should calibrate on its own when place outside, ideally in a non obscured location.
>   
> **What if the battery is dead when setting up the device?**
> 
> > If the battery is completely dead the solar panel will still get sunlight, and eventually provide power to the battery and the device itself. It will eventually go through calibration and orient itself correctly.
>   
> **Is the device waterproof?**
> 
> > A housing is required for waterproofing the electronics. You can either make one by hand or download the 3D print files (here)[https://github.com/cabledc/Senior-Design-Solar-Maximum/tree/main/3D%20Printer%20Files]. Exposing the board or wire connectors to the elements will likely damage it. Guide for attaching 3D printed the housing is [here](https://github.com/cabledc/Senior-Design-Solar-Maximum/blob/main/User%20Documentation/3D%20Printed%20Housing%20Setup.md)
