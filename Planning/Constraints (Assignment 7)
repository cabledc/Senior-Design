Some constraints for the possible solutions for our project are in the categories of economic, security, and environmental. For economics the upfront costs are more expensive than traditional solar panels. Things like extra costs for motors, computation, etc. are factors that need to be considered. For security our project will only use input voltage as a sunlight tracking method and have a closed system. It will have a security advantage as it will not need to plug into some kind of geo location or weather api that is connected to the internet. Environmental constraints is the last category that directly affects the possible solutions for our project. Things to consider are computation power, and power consumption from the motors might outweigh power efficiency that is gained from solar tracking. A side note is that this is compared to static panels. The other possible environmental constraint is that our project has to have a definite advantage over non-green energy solutions. Iâ€™m sure that other constraints on our possible solutions for our project will come up later down the line, but we will address them as they come.
